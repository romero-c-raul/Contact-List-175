# Contact List Application
  - ## Description
    - Develop a contact list application that tracks contacts and their names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
    - To add more complexity, assign contacts to categories (friends, family, work, etc)

  - ## Overall Requirements
    1. Display home page 
        - Initial `home page` will display "You have not created any groups yet"
    2. Create a group 
        - There will be a button that says `create group`
    3. Clicking on `create group` will take you to a page that has a form to create a group
        - Form asks you to "Please write down the new group's name"
          - No empty names are allowed
        - There will be a submit button
    4. After creating a group, you will be `re-directed` to the homepage and shown "Group succesfully created"
        - Homepage now shows the new group and next to it, a button that says `"View contacts"`
    5. Create a contact 
        - Clicking on "View contacts" takes you to a page that says `"You have not added any contacts yet"`
    6. Button at the bottom will say `"Add Contact"`
        - Clicking on "Add Contact" will redirect to page
        - This page will include form to add a contact and will ask for:
          - Name
          - Cellphone number
          - Email Address
          - Birthday
    7. After successfully adding a contact, you will be `redirected` to the group the contact belongs to
    8. You will also have the ability to `edit` group names, contact names, and `delete` groups and contacts.
